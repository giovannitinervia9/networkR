\title{Convert Network to Adjacency List}
\usage{
network_to_adj_list(network)
}
\arguments{
\item{network}{An object of class \code{network} containing the network's nodes and edges.}
}
\value{
A list of class \code{adj_list}, where each element corresponds to a node
in the network. Each element is a sorted vector of nodes that are adjacent
(connected) to the given node.
}
\description{
Converts a network object into an adjacency list, where each node is
associated with a list of its adjacent (connected) nodes.
}
\details{
This function iterates through each edge in the \code{network} object to populate
an adjacency list. The adjacency list is stored as a list of vectors, with
each vector representing the neighbors of a given node. For consistent ordering,
each adjacency list is sorted.
}
\examples{
# Define a simple network
graph <- list(c(1, 2), c(2, 3), c(3, 1), c(1, 4))
network <- graph_to_network(graph)

# Convert to adjacency list
adj_list <- network_to_adj_list(network)
print(adj_list)
