\title{Calculate Node Degrees and Degree Distribution for a Network}
\usage{
network_degree(network)
}
\arguments{
\item{network}{An object of class \code{network}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{network_degree}, containing:
\item{nodes_degree}{A data frame with each node and its degree.}
\item{degree_distribution}{A data frame with the degree distribution,
including absolute frequency, relative frequency, cumulative frequency,
and survival function for each degree value.}
}
\description{
This function computes the degree for each node in a network and generates
a degree distribution summary, including absolute and relative frequencies,
cumulative frequencies, and survival probabilities.
}
\examples{
# Create a network object
graph <- list(c(1, 2), c(2, 3), c(3, 1), c(1, 4))
network <- graph_to_network(graph)

# Calculate node degrees and degree distribution
degree_info <- network_degree(network)
print(degree_info$nodes_degree)
print(degree_info$degree_distribution)
