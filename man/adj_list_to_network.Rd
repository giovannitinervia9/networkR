\title{Convert Adjacency List to Network}
\usage{
adj_list_to_network(adj_list)
}
\arguments{
\item{adj_list}{A list of class \code{adj_list}, where each element is a vector
of nodes that are adjacent (connected) to the key node.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{network}, created by reconstructing edges from
the adjacency list. The resulting network object contains the nodes, edges,
and summary statistics of the network.
}
\description{
Converts an adjacency list object back into a network object with a list of edges.
}
\details{
This function reconstructs the network's edges from an adjacency list. Each
pair of connected nodes is treated as an undirected edge, so duplicate edges
are removed to ensure each edge appears only once in the network.
}
\examples{
# Create a sample adjacency list
adj_list <- list(
  `1` = c(2, 3, 4),
  `2` = c(1, 3),
  `3` = c(1, 2),
  `4` = c(1)
)
class(adj_list) <- "adj_list"

# Convert to network object
network <- adj_list_to_network(adj_list)
print(network)
