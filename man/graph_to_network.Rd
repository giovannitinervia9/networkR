\title{Convert List of Edges to Network Object}
\usage{
graph_to_network(graph)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{A list of integer pairs, where each pair represents an undirected edge in the network.
Each element in the list should be a vector of exactly two positive integers, with each integer indicating a node index.}
}
\value{
A \code{network} class object, which is a list containing the following components:
\item{graph}{A list of unique, sorted integer pairs representing the undirected edges in the network.}
\item{nodes}{A sorted vector of unique node indices present in the network.}
\item{n_nodes}{The total number of unique nodes in the network.}
\item{n_edges}{The total number of unique edges in the network.}
\item{mean_degree}{The mean degree of nodes in the network, calculated as \code{2 * n_edges / n_nodes}.}
\item{attributes}{An empty \code{data.frame} for storing node attributes, with row names as node indices.}
}
\description{
Converts a graph represented as a list of undirected edges into a \code{network} object with structured
information on nodes, edges, mean degree, and optional node attributes. This function expects each edge to be
an integer vector of length 2, indicating an undirected connection between two nodes.
}
\examples{
# Define a graph with nodes and edges
graph <- list(c(1, 2), c(2, 3), c(3, 1), c(1, 2)) # Includes duplicate edges
network <- graph_to_network(graph)
network
